### Major update to the SGID Statewide Roads Data Model

After much statewide [coordination](https://gis.utah.gov/road-centerlines-schema-update-and-regional-workshop-notes/) and [feedback](https://gis.utah.gov/feedback-wanted-draft-statewide-road-centerlines-schema-v-3-0-x/), AGRC has officially adopted a [new statewide roads data model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ_JuRIEtzxj60F0FAGmdu5JrFpfYBbSt3YzzCjxpfI/edit#gid=811360546).  The two main drivers for this update were the Next Generation 911 GIS requirements and the Federal Highway Administrationâ€™s all roads network (ARNOLD) reporting requirements for state DOTs.

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-oxxE6Ib45tJrySXmz3KnpGtBz_xJBMpVYR4T49CwPI/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed look at our ETL process, showing a a side-by-side comparison of what fields were pushed where, as well as what fields are new or deprecated (note: there are three sheets in this spreadsheet).

For your convience, we will contininue to provide the depreated data model as a [File Geodatabase download](link here) and as a published SDE Data Layer on the SGID.  The data will be current and will match what is in the new model.  We will provide the deprecated model data until March 21st, 2018.

**What you need to know:**
- New data model is based on the NextGen911 and FHA's ARNOLD requirements
- Data was ETL'ed from the old model
- spatial assignments for polygon fields
- Left / Right field values
- Recalculation of FULLNAME field
- New fields, deprecated fields
- Publishing both models until March 21sth, 2018.
