### Major update to the SGID Statewide Roads Data Model

After much statewide [coordination](https://gis.utah.gov/road-centerlines-schema-update-and-regional-workshop-notes/) and [feedback](https://gis.utah.gov/feedback-wanted-draft-statewide-road-centerlines-schema-v-3-0-x/), AGRC has officially adopted a [new statewide roads data model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ_JuRIEtzxj60F0FAGmdu5JrFpfYBbSt3YzzCjxpfI/edit#gid=811360546).  The two main drivers for this update were the Next Generation 911 GIS requirements and the Federal Highway Administrationâ€™s all roads network (ARNOLD) reporting requirements for state DOTs.
