### Major update to the SGID Statewide Roads Data Model

After much statewide [coordination](https://gis.utah.gov/road-centerlines-schema-update-and-regional-workshop-notes/) and [feedback](https://gis.utah.gov/feedback-wanted-draft-statewide-road-centerlines-schema-v-3-0-x/), AGRC has officially adopted a [new statewide roads data model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ_JuRIEtzxj60F0FAGmdu5JrFpfYBbSt3YzzCjxpfI/edit#gid=811360546).  The two main drivers for this update were the Next Generation 911 GIS requirements and the Federal Highway Administrationâ€™s all roads network (ARNOLD) reporting requirements for state DOTs.

**What you need to know:**
- Left / Right field values

[Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-oxxE6Ib45tJrySXmz3KnpGtBz_xJBMpVYR4T49CwPI/edit?usp=sharing) for a more detailed look at our ETL process, showing a a side-by-side comparison of what fields were pushed where, as well as what fields are new or deprecated (note: there are three sheets in this spreadsheet).

For your convience, we will contininue to provide the depreated data model as a [File Geodatabase download](link here) and as a published SDE Data Layer on the SGID.  The data will be current and will match what is in the new model.  We will provide the deprecated model data until March 21st, 2018.
